# eval

```js
function foo(str, a) {
	eval( str ); // cheating!
	console.log( a, b );
}

var b = 2;

foo( "var b = 3;", 1 ); // 1 3
```

The string "var b = 3;" is treated, at the point of the eval(..) call, as code that was there all along. Because that code happens to declare a new variable b, it modifies the existing lexical scope of foo(..). In fact, as mentioned above, this code actually creates variable b inside of foo(..) that shadows the b that was declared in the outer (global) scope.
